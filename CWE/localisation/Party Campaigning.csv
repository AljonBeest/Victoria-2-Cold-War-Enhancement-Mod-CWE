campaigning_farmer_title;Campaign for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Farmers;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
campaigning_farmer_desc;A farmer is a person engaged in agriculture, raising living organisms for food or raw materials. The term usually applies to people who do some combination of raising field crops, orchards, vineyards, poultry, or other livestock. A farmer might own the farmed land or might work as a laborer on land owned by others, but in advanced economies, a farmer is usually a farm owner, while employees of the farm are known as farm workers, or farmhands.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
campaigning_labourers_title;Campaign for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Miners;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
campaigning_labourers_desc;A miner is a person who extracts ore, coal, or other mineral from the earth through mining. There are two senses in which the term is used. In its narrowest sense, a miner is someone who works at the rock face cutting, blasting, or otherwise working and removing the rock. In a broader sense, a "miner" is anyone working within a mine, not just a worker at the rock face. Mining is one of the most dangerous trades in the world. In some countries, miners lack social guarantees and in case of injury may be left to cope without assistance.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
campaigning_craftsmen_title;Campaign for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Factory Workers;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
campaigning_craftsmen_desc;The factory system is a method of manufacturing using machinery and division of labour. Because of the high capital cost of machinery and factory buildings, factories were typically privately owned by wealthy individuals who employed the operative labour. Use of machinery with the division of labour reduced the required skill level of workers and also increased the output per worker. Industrialisation has placed a great deal of power into the hands of factory workers such that many  nations cannot ignore their plight.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
campaigning_business_title;Campaign for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Businessmen;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
campaigning_business_desc;A businessman or businesswoman is a person involved in the business sector – in particular someone undertaking activities (commercial or industrial) for the purpose of generating cash flow, sales, and revenue by utilising a combination of human, financial, intellectual and physical capital with a view to fueling economic development and growth.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
campaigning_middle_class_title;Campaign for the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Middle Class;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
campaigning_middle_class_desc;The middle class is a class of people in the middle of a social hierarchy. Its usage has often been vague whether defined in terms of occupation, income, education or social status. The definition by any author is often chosen for political connotations. Writers on the left favor the lower-status "working class". Modern social theorists—and especially economists—have defined and re-defined the term "middle class" in order to serve their particular social or political ends. Within capitalism, "middle-class" initially referred to the bourgeoisie, later, with the further differentiation of classes as capitalist societies developed, the term came to be synonymous with the term petite bourgeoisie.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
campaigning_military_class_title;Campaign for the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Military;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
campaigning_military_class_desc;A military, also known collectively as armed forces, is a heavily armed, highly organized force primarily intended for warfare.

campaigning_city_class_title;Campaign for Urban Interests;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
campaigning_city_class_desc;By definition, cities consist of very large numbers of people living in a relatively small amount of space. Some of these people have a good deal of money, but many people, and in some cities most people, have very little money. Cities must provide many kinds of services for all their residents, and certain additional services for their poorer residents. These basic facts of city life make for common sets of problems affecting cities throughout the nation, albeit to varying degrees, with some cities less able than others to address these problems. We shall talk a lot about this during the campaign.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
campaigning_rural_class_title;Campaign for Rural Interests;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
campaigning_rural_class_desc;In general, a rural area or countryside is a geographic area that is located outside towns and cities. The Health Resources and Services Administration of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services defines the word rural as encompassing "...all population, housing, and territory not included within an urban area. Whatever is not urban is considered rural". Typical rural areas have a low population density and small settlements. Agricultural areas are commonly rural, as are other types of areas such as forests. Different countries have varying definitions of rural for statistical and administrative purposes.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;

campaigning_dictatorship_poor_desc;The working class (or labouring class) comprises those engaged in waged or salaried labour, especially in manual-labour occupations and industrial work.

campaigning_dictatorship_reformists_title;Court the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Party Reformists;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
campaigning_dictatorship_reformists_desc;There are certain sections in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Government who advocate for political reform of our authoritarian system. We can choose to promote some of these reformists to more senior positions in the government in order to help with any liberalisation plans the $MONARCHTITLE$ may have.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
campaigning_dictatorship_hardliners_title;Court the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Party Hardliners;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
campaigning_dictatorship_hardliners_desc;There are certain sections in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Government who advocate for the continued rule of our totalitarian system.

campaigning_secularism_title;Campaign for Secularism;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
campaigning_secularism_desc;Secularism may refer to any worldview or principle which defines the secular at a given context, and prioritises, justifies or promotes it over the non-secular. "Secularism" has a broad range of meaning. While its definition as the separation of religion from civic affairs and the state is the most common, it may connote anticlericalism, atheism, naturalism, banishment of religious symbols from the public sphere and much more.;;;;;;;;;;X;;;;;;;
