EVT_9001023_DESC;The 23rd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) took place in Moscow, RSFSR between 29 March and 8 April 1966. It was the first Congress during Leonid Brezhnev's leadership of the Party and state. This Congress will provide places for personalities in key positions, such as Brezhnev, Kosygin and others. But it is important on because it will determine the new five-year plan of the USSR. Kosygin and his supporters, with a large majority, proposes to study the proposals of Libermann, an economist. However, there is an alternative proposed by Cybernetics, that of automating the Soviet economy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001024_DESC;Not surprisingly, Liberman's reforms were chosen. This would give greater management autonomy to companies (freedom to set a price and a salary, to hire, to order...). It will be first experimented in the Shchyokinsky chemical plant at the beginning. However, this reform meets resistance from conservatives, such as Leonid Brezhnev, because it requires the party to loosen its grip on the Soviet economy and fears that this will lead to the emergence of a kind of technocracy capable of challenging their decisions, powers and privileges. Should you fully adopt Liberman's Reforms or make a compromise and adopt it partially?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001025_DESC;It was with surprise that Victor Glushkov's ideas resurfaced. Cybernetics is far from unknown and the project of automating the Soviet economy already dates back to Stalin's time. But the party seems to have realized the full potential of this project that could move the Soviet Union in the field of science and computer science ahead of the West and may well save the country in the future. The CPSU has already released money to generalize computers. It remains to be seen whether we want partial or complete automation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001027_DESC;In order to greatly improve the access and organization of our economy, it was decided a few years ago to introduce computers massively. This first step was reached and it became common for the Soviets to work with computers, no matter how big they are.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001033_DESC;We have just passed a new milestone, an automated calculation system has been created in order to reduce falsifications and better organize working time. This is the core of the OGAS project...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001034_DESC;We have managed to install a computer network to link our computers to better communicate information across the country and allow acceleration in the field of research. This is already a great leap forward for the West. Our economy is now much easier to manage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_9001070_DESC;In March 1956, rallies took place in Georgia, especially in its capital, Tbilisi. Demonstrations took place to denounce Khrushchev's speech, many of the demonstrators were Stalinists, but also nationalists, who saw Stalin as an icon of their national identity. Now, strong demands are said, such as the independence of Georgia or a radical change of the central government in Moscow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_9001071_DESC;Stalin's legacy has always been a problem in the Soviet Union, especially for the ruling class, and has had many reactions and consequences in the socialist camp. Today, the question is still raised, some radicals would like to establish a real cult for Stalin, to see him above all as the one who turned the country from a backward nation into a world power or a figure of anti-fascism. Others, more moderate and conservative, would like to create a commission to judge Stalin's role for the country (Stalin made mistakes, but above all he had an important role for the country). And finally, more "reformist" people would like to denounce Stalin in all aspects and concepts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
